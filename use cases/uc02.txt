User creates a file layout02.txt that contains the following layout definition:

# begin layout definition

start: str
str x 3
crvl x 4
insw:  out.tor.in
outsw: tol

crvl x 4
str6 x 4
crvl x 4

> in.$start

$outsw.left
crvl x 6

> right.$insw

# end layout definition

This creates an outer loop that connects to an inner circle at the two switches. Trains can stay on one loop or the other and can switch back and forth.

Layout structure:
- Outer loop: start → 3 straights → 4 left curves (90°) → right turnout (insw) → left turnout (outsw) → 4 left curves → 4 short straights → 4 left curves → closes back to start
- Inner circle: branches from outsw.left → 6 left curves (135°) → connects to insw.right

The `>` operator closes the loop by connecting the current piece's output to a labeled piece's input.
