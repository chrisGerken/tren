Problem:
When running "npm run tauri dev", the Vite dev server starts on port 5173.
Accessing http://192.168.68.52:5173 from another machine on the same WiFi
network results in an "unable to connect" error.

Cause:
By default, Vite binds its dev server to "localhost" (127.0.0.1), which is the
loopback interface. This means the server only accepts connections originating
from the local machine. Requests from other machines on the network are refused
because they arrive on the machine's network interface (e.g., 192.168.68.52),
not on the loopback interface.

Solution:
In vite.config.ts, add host: '0.0.0.0' to the server configuration. This
tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, including the WiFi adapter,
allowing other machines on the local network to connect.

  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 5173,
    strictPort: true,
  },

If the issue persists after this change, verify that the macOS firewall is not
blocking incoming connections on port 5173 (System Settings > Network > Firewall).
