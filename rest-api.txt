# Tren REST API Contract (Draft)

Use Cases

uc1) Trains can't move because they are in grid lock. The user needs to move specific trains forwards or backwards, overriding desired speed and direction as well as ignoring or overriding points locked via the lockahead mechanism

uc2) The user wants to direct a train to a specific track and needs directions in the form of a series of switch options

uc3) The user wants to run a railyard scenario and needs to control car connects and disconnects and train movement forwards and backwards

uc4)

General notes:
	- All endpoints return JSON. 
	- Numeric IDs are DWORD (32-bit unsigned integer) uuid's, auto-assigned incrementally. Base URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`
	- Unless explicitly included, object coordinates, rotation, material and other attributes that three.js would be interested in are not to be included in this restful api contract
	- Terminus track pieces include the generator, bin, decoupler and semaphore archetypes. The common 
	  connection point for all branches of a virtual switch is also considered a terminus piece.
	- Sections of layout are those sequences of track that are enclosed within two terminus track pieces, one on 
	  each end and which contain no terminus track pieces. 
	  
## Resource: System

	GET  /system/layouts  returns a list of available layout descriptors each with one layout's title, description and id
	PUT  /system/load/id  loads the layout with the specified id
	PUT  /system/import   loads the layout specification in the body of the request      
	PUT  /system/stop	  halts simulation while preserving all state of all simulation objects
	PUT  /system/start    resumes simulation. Note that objects may have been modified during pausing
	PUT  /system/reset    stops and returns the layout to its inital state (as defined in the layout specification). 

## Resource: Layout

Properties:
    - property id , a double word value
	- all properties that can be set in layout specification DSL, including logging
	- all runtime properties (labels, random, etc.)
	- an array of switches
	- an array of semaphors
	- an array of trains
	- an array of layout sections	
	

Methods
	GET  /layout		returns a JSON object with data (scalar or array of objects) for each attribute  
	PUT  /layout		takes a JSON object with data for each attribute (scalar only) to be changed

	- the number of cars

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/trains` | List all trains |
| GET | `/trains/:id` | Get a specific train |

| POST | `/trains/:id/stop` | Stop a train (set speed to 0) |
| POST | `/trains/:id/start` | Resume a train (restore desired speed) |

**GET /trains** response:
```json

      "desiredSpeed": 12.0,
      "generatorId": "piece_1",
      "headPosition": { "x": 45.2, "z": 12.8 },
      "headPieceId": "piece_15",
      "visible": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**GET /trains/:id** response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "carCount": 6,
  "cabCount": 1,
  "currentSpeed": 12.0,
  "desiredSpeed": 12.0,
  "generatorId": "piece_1",
  "cars": [
    {
      "carId": "car_1",
      "type": "cab",
      "position": { "x": 45.2, "z": 12.8 },
      "rotation": 1.57,
      "pieceId": "piece_15",
      "visible": true
    },
    {
      "carId": "car_2",
      "type": "car",
      "position": { "x": 42.1, "z": 12.8 },
      "rotation": 1.57,
      "pieceId": "piece_14",
      "visible": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**PUT /trains/:id** request:
```json
{
  "desiredSpeed": 8.0
}
```

**POST /trains/:id/stop** — no request body, sets currentSpeed and desiredSpeed to 0.

**POST /trains/:id/start** request (optional body):
```json
{
  "speed": 12.0
}
```
If no body/speed provided, restores the original desired speed from when the train was spawned.
