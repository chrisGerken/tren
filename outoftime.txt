1) If you are in the middle of a list of tasks and some are not completed then write enough information to resumeTasks.txt so that you can continue performing the task in the next session when I type "perform tasks in resumeTasks.txt"

2) Update all .md and .html files ass appropriate with design and implementation decisions during this session so that the conterxt is ready to load for the next session
