1) Replace resumeTasks.txt with an empty file and as work progresses on the remaining tasks continue to update resumeTasks.txt with any information needed to resume these tasks in the situation where my usage hits a limit and is cut off.

--------------------

2) Make the area in which clicks to a decoupler's triangles are caught twice as large as they are now.

3) On either side of the train target speed slider place buttons with a "-" and a "+" to decrement and increment the target speed respectively.

4) Remove the static string "ID:" from the train inspector widget.

5) Replace the Change Direction label with an icon that implies "going back and forth" or "changing direction"

6) Add a button at the top of the window, next to "Labels" and label it "Capture". When clicked, get the
three.js camera we're using to render to an image (jpeg, png, or whatever is supported) so as to capture 
a screenshot of just the train simulation window. Use a "Save File As..." dialog to let the user choose the name
and location of the file.
