1) Replace resumeTasks.txt with an empty file and as work progresses on the remaining tasks continue to update resumeTasks.txt with any information needed to resume these tasks in the situation where my usage hits a limit and is cut off.

--------------------

2) add a new statement to the layout specification DSL: logging ("log" for short)  with one of four constant options: DEBUG,
  INFO, WARNING and ERROR to control how much information gets written to the browser console. When one of the constants     
  is specified then any log messages at that severity or greater get written to the browser console. INFO should be for      
  user-understood events like new train, train binned, layour specification loaded, etc. Multiple logs statements can        
  appear in one layout specification, especially if the layout author wants to debug a specific section of track layout.
  
 3) update the code to find all places where the logic writes to the log and make the appropriate assignment of severity to each log entry for filtering by the log statement
