1) Create a new track archetype called semaphore which in it's simplest form is a zero-length track with one connection point (referred to by both in and out) that has a visual rendering on the screen as (1) a red or green dot (similar to the dots used as switch indicators) and (2) a circle, not filled in, the same size as the current bin and generator visuals and centered on the dot in (1). Clicking on a green dot with lock the connection point (so trains won't pass over it) and turn the indicator red. Clicking on a red indicator with turn it green and unlock the connection point so trains can pass over it once they've lock the other necessary connection points before and after. The piece starts in the green, unlocked state. Note that while the semaphore has zero length, it probably does have one connection point labeled both in and out, like the implementation for the tunnel archetype.

2) Create a new statement in the layout specification DSL: sempaphore (or sem for short). The statement causes an unlocked semaphore to be added to the track at that point.
